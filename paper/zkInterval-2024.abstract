  In this paper, we introduce zkInterval, a novel zero-knowledge range proof protocol that delivers fixed-size proofs regardless of the interval size. Combining Pedersen commitments with zero-knowledge proofs, zkInterval securely confirms that a value is within a public interval without revealing it or requiring a trusted setup. The consistent proof size irrespective of the interval length significantly reduces storage, making zkInterval particularly well-suited for privacy-focused applications with variable interval lengths. The zkInterval protocol enhances the efficiency and scalability of cryptographic range proofs, providing a reliable and efficient solution to contemporary cryptographic demands.
