  In this paper, we introduce zkInterval, a novel constant-size zero-knowledge range proof protocol that proves a secret value lies within a public interval without revealing it or requiring a trusted setup. Leveraging Pedersen commitments and advanced zero-knowledge techniques, zkInterval offers a trustless and confidential solution with proofs whose size remains invariant regardless of the interval's range. This property significantly reduces storage and communication overhead, making zkInterval particularly well-suited for privacy-focused applications and scenarios with variable interval lengths. Our protocol enhances the efficiency and scalability of cryptographic range proofs, offering a robust solution to some critical challenges in modern cryptographic systems.
